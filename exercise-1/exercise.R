# Exercise 1: Lists


# Create a vector of everything you ate for breakfast
my.breakfast <- c('cereal', 'milk', 'apple')

# Create a vector of everything you ate for lunch
my.lunch <- c('sandwich', 'juice', 'chips', 'pizza')

# Create a list `meals` that has contains your breakfast and lunch
meals <- list(breakfast=my.breakfast, lunch=my.lunch)

# Add a `dinner` index to your `meals` list that has what you plan to eat for dinner
meals$dinner <- c('kimchi', 'stew', 'meat')

# Extract your 'dinner' element from your list and save it in a vector called 'dinner'
dinner <- meals[['dinner']]

# Create a list that has the number of items you ate for each meal
items <- lapply(meals, length)

# Write a function that adds pizza to every meal
